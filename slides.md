developers into open source software development. Participants work with an

the guidance of a mentor.

- Receive a stipend and certificate upon completion.

## What is *NOT* GSoC?

# Choosing an Organization

## Identify Interests
- Choose a project area that matches your skills and interests

## Explore Organizations
- Check out the list of participating organizations on the [GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

## Read Project Ideas
- Each organization lists project ideas, but you can also propose your own ideas aligned with the organization's goals.

---

# Choosing an Organization

## Interact, give and get help

- Be active on communication channels and interact with your mentors and other contributors.
- Different people have different skills- they can help you and vice versa
- Discuss your ideas!
- Be respectful, but don't address people by Sir/Ma'am. Title (`Prof./Dr./Ms./Mr. <Surname>`) is OK. 

## BUT, don't be spammy

- There is a thin like between being active and spamming endlessly.
- Be aware that Open Source is something people do voluntarily - respect their time.

# Writing a Strong Proposal

Your proposal is key to being selected. Here's a structure to consider:

- **Introduction**: Briefly introduce yourself and your background.
- **Project Goals**: Clearly define what the project aims to achieve.
- **Implementation Plan**: Break down your approach into phases or milestones.
- **Timeline**: Include a week-by-week schedule with achievable goals.
- **About You**: Share your technical skills and past experiences.
- **Why This Project?**: Explain why you chose this project and how you'll add value.

## Tips
- Keep it concise and focused.
- Show you understand the project and its requirements.
- Provide links to your GitHub or previous work.

---

# Selection process

This is organisation dependent.
- Just based on the proposal (most common)
- Interviews
- Tasks

---

# Getting Started with Open Source

If you're new to open source:
- **Contribute to Small Issues**: Start with “good first issue” labels.
- **Read Documentation**: Understand the organization's guidelines and contribution workflow.
- **Ask for Help**: Most open-source communities are supportive; don't hesitate to reach out on forums or chats.

# Other programs

- Outreachy
- Google Season of Docs
- Major League Hacking (MLH) fellowship
- GirlScript Summer of Code
- LFX Mentorship (Linux Foundation)
- and many more.....

# Q/A

## What if I get selected for multiple projects?

> it's a case-by-case basis, and either Google or one of the mentors from the competing orgs will ask you to give preference.
> I usually won't suggest giving a preference at any point since that is unnecessary. Google will pick one for you based on which org ranked you higher so you don't need to give out prefs unless they really insist.
